# MEANAuth

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.
The repo holds both client-side as well as server-side code.
Before using, ensure that you have installed the latest version of Node, NPM and Angular CLi on your device.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository to a directory in your device
- Install all the dependencies by running 'npm i --save' inside the cloned Angular project folder as well as within the 'api' folder
- Once dependencies are installed, test the project by running 'ng serve' in the cloned folder and 'node app.js' in the 'api'folder
- If all goes well, you should now have a login page greeting you at 'http://localhost:4200'
- Please note that you can check the success of login only through the server-side log as no page has been defined for the redirection after successful login.
- Feel free to report any bugs you find
